# Cascade-Learning
A simple example of cascade learning. 

This is the implementation of Cascade Learning algorithm using [Cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

## Getting Started
Our code is starting from cascade learning from scratch by running CIFAR_10_main.py, where the setting of bugs test version is the default. If you want to specify the parameters, please go to parameters.py to modify settings for meeting your reqirements. The details of each parameters can be found there.
All of trained models on the source domain will be automatically saved in a folder.

### Prerequisites

##### install pytorch
please see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#### then run
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
